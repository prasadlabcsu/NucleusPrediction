# Nuclear Shape Prediction from Cell Shape
## From the paper: Cell morphology accurately predicts the nuclear shape of adherent cells
This repository contains scripts and generated data files to recreate the figures, models, and data obtained in our work. 

The U-Net CNN model architecture was inspired by the Vox2Vox 3D GAN model by Marco Domenico Cirillo, David Abramian, and Anders Eklund.

All relevant data files to recreate figures and tables from the paper are included. Original image data and saved models are stored in this repository. (NEED LINK!!!)

The ANN and MLR models are created and trained in MATLAB, and their results are plotted and analyzed in MATLAB as well.

The CNN models are created and trained in Tensorflow.
